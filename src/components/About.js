             <p>As a new Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University, I am ready and eager to fit into whatever software engineering position that is needed. Having been exposed to many core computer science concepts, I am ready to hit the ground running wherever desired. If I havenâ€™t learned something, I am not afraid to admit it, and will work tirelessly to learn it as fast as I can. </p>
             <p>I was born and raised in Hood River, Oregon, and I would be thrilled with an opportunity to stay here and work as a software engineer. My family owns a Christmas Tree farm in the valley which I have loved working on my entire life.</p>
             <p>In my free time I enjoy all of which Hood River has to offer, which includes skiing on Mt. Hood in the winter, and boating and wakeboarding on the Columbia River Gorge in the summer.</p>
